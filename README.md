# WeatherGetter
For my high school homework......It's not possible to record the weather everyday at all! Why teachers usually think we're free?

Clone it and run this:
```shell
python Manager.py
```
**Attention:**
* It depends on these moudles: requests, fake-useragent, apscheduler 
* It runs in Python3, not 2
* Its data is from [和风天气](https://www.hewether.com)
* It can only run on Linux. Fxxk Microsoft.
